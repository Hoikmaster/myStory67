Bob was out on a walk.
While on his walk, he noticed that the sky was getting dark and stormy.
He decided to go home immediately so that he wouldn't be caught outside if it rained.
He started running towards his house, which was many blocks away.
While on the way he met Jack, who was driving his car back home.
"Bob! Come here! I'll drop you home! Looks like its gonna rain." said Jack  .
"Thanks!" said Bob, when he was inside the car.
"Looks like its gonna be a real downpour tonight." said Jack.
